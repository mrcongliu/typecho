# Typecho

Typecho is a blog system.

It is available on DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/joyqi/typecho

# Customization

I need to have it running in a container with its mysql db auto configured.

And I also need a custom Theme added into the container file system.

So I created a image based on the base image by creating a Dockerfile.

This project should be a starting point for my local blog development with Typecho.
